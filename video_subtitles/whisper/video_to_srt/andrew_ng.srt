1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,800
When I think about the rise of AI, I'm reminded by the rise of literacy.

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,640
A few hundred years ago, many people in society thought that maybe not everyone needed to

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,760
be able to read and write.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,200
Back then, many people were attending fused or hurting sheep, so maybe there was less

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,160
need for written communication.

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,960
And all that was needed was for the high priest and priestesses and monks to be able to

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,600
read the holy book, and the rest of us could just go to the temple or church or the holy

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,760
building and sit and listen to the high priest and priestesses read to us.

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,800
Fortunately, we're since figured out that we can build a much richer society if lots

10
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,960
of people can read and write.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,960
Today, AI is in the hands of the high priest and priestesses.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,920
These are the highly skilled AI engineers, many of whom work on the big tech companies.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,040
And most people have access only to the AI that they build for them.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:02,040
I think that we can build a much richer society if we can enable everyone to help to write

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,200
the future.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,840
But why is AI largely concentrated in the big tech companies?

17
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,440
Because many of these AI projects have been expensive to build.

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,240
They may require dozens of high-disco engineers and it may cost millions or tens of millions

19
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,440
of dollars to build an AI system.

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,360
And the large tech companies, particularly the ones with hundreds of millions or even

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:29,520
billions of users, have been better than anyone else at making these investments pay off.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,760
Because for them, one size fits all AI systems, such as one that improves web search or that

23
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,760
recommends that the products for online shopping can be applied to this very large number of

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,800
users to generate a massive amount of revenue.

25
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,360
But this recipe for AI does not work once you go outside to tech and internet sectors to

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,560
other places where, for the most part, there are hardly any projects that apply to a hundred

27
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,240
million people or that generates comparable economics.

28
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,120
Let me illustrate an example.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:10,080
Many weekends, I drive a few minutes from my house to a local pizza store to buy a slice

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,720
of Hawaiian pizza from the gentleman that owns this pizza store.

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,040
And his pizza is great.

32
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,560
But he always has a lot of coat, pizza sitting around.

33
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,440
And every weekend, some different flavor of pizza is all the style.

34
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,680
But when I wash him off of his store, I get excited because by selling pizza, he is generating

35
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,280
data.

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,240
And this is data that he can take advantage of if he had access to AI.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,440
AI systems are good at spotting patterns when given access to the right data.

38
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,120
And perhaps an AI system could spot if Mediterranean pizzas sell really well on a Friday night,

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,520
because it suggested him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon.

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,720
Now you might say to me, hey Andrew, this is a small pizza store.

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,400
What's the big deal?

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,960
And I say to the gentleman that owns this pizza store, something that could help him improve

43
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:08,880
his revenues by a few thousand dollars a year that will be a huge deal to him.

44
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:14,680
I know that there is a lot of hype about AI's need for massive data sets.

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:21,400
And having more data does help, but contrary to the hype, AI can often work just fine even

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,920
on models and models of data, such as the data generated by a single pizza store.

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,000
So the real problem is not that there isn't enough data from the pizza store.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,400
The real problem is that the small pizza store could never serve enough customers to justify

49
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,520
the cost of hiring an AI team.

50
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,600
I know that in the United States, there are about half a million independent restaurants, and

51
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,680
collectively, these restaurants do serve tens of millions of customers.

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,320
But every restaurant has difference with a different menu, different customers, different

53
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,760
ways of recording sales that no one size fits our AI will work for all of them.

54
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,800
What would it be like if we could enable small businesses and especially local businesses

55
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
to use AI?

56
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,840
Let's take a look at what it might look like at a company that makes and sells t-shirts.

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,880
I would love if an accountant working for the t-shirt company can use AI for demand forecasting,

58
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,760
say figure out what funny means the print on t-shirts that would drive sales by looking

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,440
at what's trending on social media.

60
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,880
Or for product placement, why can't a front-to-store manager take pictures of what the store

61
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,880
looks like and show it to an AI and have an AI recommend where to place products to improve

62
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,880
sales?

63
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Supply chain?

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,760
Can an AI recommend a buyer whether or not they should pay $20 per yard for a piece of

65
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,360
fabric now or if they should keep looking because they might be defined at cheaper elsewhere?

66
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,840
Or quality control?

67
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,000
A quality inspector should be able to use AI to automatically scan pictures of the fabric

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
they used to make t-shirts to check if there are any tears or discolourations in the

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
cloth.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,120
Today, large tech companies routinely use AI to solve problems like these and to grade

71
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,920
effect.

72
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:14,200
But a typical t-shirt company or a typical auto mechanic or retailer or school or local

73
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,160
firm will be using AI for exactly zero of these applications today.

74
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,560
Every t-shirt maker is sufficiently different from every other t-shirt maker that there

75
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,440
is no one-size-bizel AI that will work for all of them.

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,760
And in fact, once you go outside the internet and tech sectors in other industries, even

77
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,800
large companies such as pharmaceutical companies, the car makers, hospitals also struggle with

78
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
this.

79
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,640
This is the long-tailed problem of AI.

80
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,680
If you were to take all current and potential AI projects and sort them in decreasing order

81
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,400
of value and plot them, you'd get grounded looks like this.

82
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,080
Either single-moles-validable AI system is something that decides what ads to show

83
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,720
people on the internet.

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,960
Maybe the second-moles-validable is a web search engine.

85
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,680
Maybe the third-moles-validable is an online shopping product recommendation system.

86
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,840
But when you go to the right of this curve, you then get projects like t-shirt product

87
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:20,320
placements or t-shirt demand forecasting or pizzeria demand forecasting.

88
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,200
And each of these is a unique project that needs to be custom built.

89
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,560
When t-shirt demand forecasting, it depends on trending memes on social media, it's a very

90
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,520
different project than pizzeria demand forecasting if that depends on the pizzeria sales data.

91
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,320
So today, there are millions of projects sitting on the tail of this distribution that no

92
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,720
one is working on, but whose aggregate value is massive.

93
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,240
So how can we enable small businesses and individuals to build AI systems that matter

94
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,280
to them?

95
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,960
Well, most of the last few decades, if you want to build an AI system, this is what you

96
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
have to do.

97
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,320
You have to write pages and pages of code.

98
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,840
And while I would love for everyone to learn to code, and in fact, online education and

99
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,880
also offline education are helping more people than ever learn to code, unfortunately, not

100
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,000
everyone has the time to do this.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,360
But there is an emerging new way to build AI systems that will let more people participate.

102
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,160
Just as pen and paper, which are a vastly superior technology to stone, tablet and chisel,

103
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,800
were instrumental to widespread literacy, there are emerging new AI development platforms

104
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,280
that shift the focus from asking you to write lots of code, to asking you to focus on providing

105
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:43,440
data, and this turns out to be much easier for a lot of people to do.

106
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,000
Today, there are multiple companies working on platforms like these.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,280
I want to illustrate a few of the concepts using one that my team has been building.

108
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:58,560
Take the example of an inspector wanting AI to help detect defects in fabric.

109
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,760
An inspector can take pictures of the fabric and upload it to a platform like this, and

110
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,600
they can go in to show the AI what tears in the fabric looks like by drawing rectangles.

111
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,200
And they can also go in to show the AI what discolourations in the fabric looks like by

112
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,320
drawing rectangles.

113
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,640
So these pictures together with the green and pink rectangles that the inspector's

114
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:28,720
drawing are data created by the inspector to explain to AI how to find tears and discolourations.

115
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,080
After the AI examines this data, we may find that it has seen enough pictures of tears,

116
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,640
but not yet enough pictures of discolourations.

117
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,360
This is akin to if a junior inspector had learned to rely on these spot tears, but still

118
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,800
needs to further hone the judgment about discolourations.

119
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,920
So the inspector can go back and take more pictures of discolourations to show to the

120
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,760
AI to help it deepen this understanding.

121
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,560
By adjusting the data you give to the AI, you can help the AI get smarter.

122
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:03,600
So an inspector using an accessible platform like this can in a few hours to a few days,

123
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:10,320
and with purchasing a suitable camera setup, be able to build a custom AI system to detect

124
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,400
defects, tears and discolourations in all the fabric being used to make teachers throughout

125
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,880
the factory.

126
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:24,160
And once again, you may say, hey, Andrew, this is one factory, like why is this a big deal?

127
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,440
And I say to you, does this a big deal to that inspector whose life this makes easier?

128
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,960
And equally, this type of technology can empower a baker to use AI to check for the quality

129
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,440
of the cakes they're making, or a organic farmer to check the quality of the vegetables,

130
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,120
or a furniture maker to check the quality of the wood they're using.

131
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,000
Platforms like these will probably still need a few more years before they're easy enough

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,320
to use for every Pizzeria owner, but many of these platforms are coming along, and some

133
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,160
of them are getting to be quite usable to someone that has tech savvy today with just

134
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,840
a bit of training.

135
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,480
But what this means is that rather than relying on the high-prease and pre-susages to write

136
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,720
AI systems for everyone else, we can start to empower every accountant, every store manager,

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:17,480
every buyer, and every whole team inspector to build their own AI systems.

138
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:23,200
I hope that the Pizzeria owner and many other small business owners like him will also take

139
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,200
advantage of this technology, because AI is creating tremendous wealth and will continue

140
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,040
to create tremendous wealth.

141
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,000
And it's only by democratizing access to AI that can ensure that this wealth is spread

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,080
far and wide across society.

143
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,600
Hundreds of years ago, I think hardly anyone understood the impact that widespread literacy

144
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
will have.

145
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,640
Today, I think hardly anyone understands the impact that democratizing access to AI will

146
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,400
have.

147
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,160
Building AI systems has been other reach for most people, but that does not have to be

148
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,480
the case.

149
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,240
In the coming era of AI, we will empower everyone to build AI systems for themselves, and I

150
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,160
think that will be a incredibly exciting future.

151
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Thank you very much.
