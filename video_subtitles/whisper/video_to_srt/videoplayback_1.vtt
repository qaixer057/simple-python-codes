If you have a little bit of anxiety around the idea of taking calculus, I would encourage you to give it a chance.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
We don't all learn in the same way.

00:11.000 --> 00:16.000
So we are going to be teaching the same content in different ways.

00:17.000 --> 00:24.000
I'd say my teaching style is somewhat laid back on the only instructor that's using a blackboard.

00:24.000 --> 00:31.000
And I prefer a fountain pen and paper. I want to make calculus a bit more human.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
I'll be teaching with a tablet. We're going to look at the infinitely large, the infinitely small.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
There's going to be a lot of storytelling alongside calculus.

00:43.000 --> 00:50.000
I hate to do this to my hometown team, but we're going to look at the Buffalo Bills fan base as our example for exponential decay.

00:50.000 --> 00:57.000
So here we go. Low-d high minus high-d low over low low. Why? Let's piece it together.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.000
There are these mathematical functions in the things that make us happy.

01:02.000 --> 01:07.000
This is an example of taking something in the real world and even more information through the equations.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
Basically, if you're in your 20s, enjoy it while it lasts.

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
There is no reason why everyone shouldn't have access to the very best education.

01:20.000 --> 01:27.000
I hope this course can be a gateway to help students from different backgrounds to start their college career.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
Calculus is this place where once you master the rules, you can let your curiosity run completely right.

01:36.000 --> 01:43.000
Welcome to Calculus 1. Let's get started. Let's get started. Let's get started.
