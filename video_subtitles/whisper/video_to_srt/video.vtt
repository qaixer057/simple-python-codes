00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
The biggest poison in us is regret.

00:07.000 --> 00:11.000
I think there are a lot of people that have dreams

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
and aspirations of things that they always wanted to do,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.000
but it wasn't the right time, where they didn't have enough money

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
or they didn't have enough experience.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
It's never the right time.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
You're never going to have the right experience.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
And all of a sudden you wake up and you're 70.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
And you're like, God, I wish I could have done it.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
It's what you don't do that screws with you later on.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
I get one shot at this life.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
This is it.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
And I don't want to go through life being the 80% version of me.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
I don't want to look back and be like 77 and be like,

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I didn't do that.

00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
There's so much I want to do and I love life so much.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
I don't want to miss it.
