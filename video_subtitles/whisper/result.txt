 Vincent and I have had an amazing relationship for many years, many, many years. And it all began with WrestleMania number four in Atlantic City where frankly I met the largest man I've ever seen to this date, the great Andre the Giant, who was great. That was a terrific time. But the thing that I guess we're known for is the battle of the billionaires. And to this date, to this date, it has the highest ratings, the highest pay-per-view in the history of wrestling of any kind.
